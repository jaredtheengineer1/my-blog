## Why I'm Doing This

This is my first post on my new blog built with TypeScript and markdown. I'm on a journey to learn more, to document my learning, and to gain experience that will help me advance in my career. 

I've done Full Stack and Backend development in the past, but for the last few years I've been really focusing on the Frontend. By completing these projects I'm hoping that I can
- Learn a new language
- Work on both my communication and teaching
- Gain a deeper understanding of some of the things I work with every day

## What I'm Building

I'm learning:
- Rust systems programming
- HTTP servers from scratch
- JavaScript engines
- CSS engines
- This blog

All of these projects will be open source, and they can be found [on my Github](https://github.com/jaredtheengineer1).  This blog will also be under constant development. It'd be pretty cool if a comment section popped up at some point, right? Discussion would help me figure out what I'm not explaining, what I don't yet understand myself, and help with my goal of working on my communication skills.

Check back for weekly updates!
