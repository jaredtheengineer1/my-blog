# Starting My Engineering Blog

This is my first post on my new blog built with TypeScript and markdown.

## Why I'm Doing This

I'm on a journey to learn more, to document my learning, and to gain experience that will help me advance in my career

## What I'm Building

I'm learning:
- Rust systems programming
- HTTP servers from scratch
- JavaScript engines
- CSS engines

Check back for weekly updates!
