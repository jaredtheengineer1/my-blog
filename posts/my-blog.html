        <h2>Why I&#39;m Doing This</h2>
<p>This is my first post on my new blog built with TypeScript and markdown. I&#39;m on a journey to learn more, to document my learning, and to gain experience that will help me advance in my career. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve done Full Stack and Backend development in the past, but for the last few years I&#39;ve been really focusing on the Frontend. By completing these projects I&#39;m hoping that I can</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn a new language</li>
<li>Work on both my communication and teaching</li>
<li>Gain a deeper understanding of some of the things I work with every day</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I&#39;m Building</h2>
<p>I&#39;m learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust systems programming</li>
<li>HTTP servers from scratch</li>
<li>JavaScript engines</li>
<li>CSS engines</li>
<li>This blog</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these projects will be open source, and they can be found <a href="https://github.com/jaredtheengineer1">on my Github</a>.  This blog will also be under constant development. It&#39;d be pretty cool if a comment section popped up at some point, right? Discussion would help me figure out what I&#39;m not explaining, what I don&#39;t yet understand myself, and help with my goal of working on my communication skills.</p>
<p>Check back for weekly updates!</p>
